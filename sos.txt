User: Hello Darkness my old friend.

Cleverbot: I've come to talk with you again.

User: Because a vision softly creeping.

Cleverbot: Left its seed while I was sleepiing.

User: And the vision, that it planted in my brain, Still remains.

Cleverbot: Within the sound of silence.

User: In restless dreams I walked alone.

Cleverbot: Narrow streets of cobblestone.

User: 'Neath the halo a street lamp.

Cleverbot: I turned my collar to the cold and damp.

User: Then my eyes were stabbed by light of neon sign.

Cleverbot: That split the night and touched the sound of silence.

User: In the naked light I saw.

Cleverbot: Ten thousand people, maybe more.

User: People talking without speaking.

Cleverbot: People hearing without listening.

User: People writing songs that voices never share.

Cleverbot: And no one dare.

User: Disturb the sound of silence.

Cleverbot: Fools I said you do not know.

User: Silence like a cancer grows.

Cleverbot: Hear my words that I might teach you.

User: Take my arms that I may reach you.

Cleverbot: But my words, like silent raindrops fell.

User: And echoed in the wells of silence.

Cleverbot: And the people bowed and prayed.

User: To the neon gods they made.

Cleverbot: And the sign flashed out its warning.

User: In the words that it was forming.

Cleverbot: And the signs said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls.

User: And tenement halls, And wispered in the sound of silence.
